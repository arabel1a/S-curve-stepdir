# S-curve-stepdir

Here is a S-curve acceleration/deceleration algorithm for step motors, a dummy trajectory planner and a visulization tool. 

You can use this for operating with step/dir drives on a microcontroller such as Arduino or STM32.

This repository will be filled and framed in several days.
